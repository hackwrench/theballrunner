/**
 * @brief Generic protocol for enumerating collections of server-side resources.
 *
 * Objects conforming to the GreeEnumerator protocol are created by the component class APIs to page
 * over any (potentially) large set of data. In most cases you can expect id<GreeEnumerator> objects
 * to be returned from the various API class methods beginning with load.
 *
 * The typical API usage pattern looks something like this:
 * @code
 *  [GreeScore loadTopScoresForLeaderboard:leaderboard_id timePeriod:GreeScoreTimePeriodAlltime block:^(NSArray* scores, NSError* error) {
 *     // process top page of scores
 *  }];
 * @endcode
 * 
 * with enumerators, however, you can retrieve more than the first page of data:
 *
 * @code
 *  id<GreeEnumerator> allScoreEnumerator = [GreeScore loadTopScoresForLeaderboard:@"" timePeriod:GreeScoreTimePeriodAlltime block:^(NSArray* scores, NSError* error) {
 *     // process top page of scores
 *  }];
 *  // some time later... after user presses "next", etc.
 *  [allScoreEnumerator loadNext:^(NSArray* scores, NSError* error) {
 *     // process second page of scores
 *  }];
 * @endcode
 *
 * When you have exhausted the data set your returned items will be nil.
