/*
There are several types of requests that can be made using this class
 Most requests will be sent to the Gree server, these must be signed with OAuth
 Most of the time, you will use one of the following to make a JSON request:
  getPath:parameters:success:failure, 
  postPath:parameters:success:failure, 
  putPath:parameters:success:failure, 
  deletePath:parameters:success:failure
    
 Non-JSON requests:
    rawRequestWithMethod:path:parameters:success:failure
 
 The rest of these are not expected to be used very often.
 To make a request without queuing it, there are two possibilities:
 For JSON:
    requestWithMethod:path:parameters:
 for non-JSON:
    use [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:], base the URL from self.baseURL
 
 To sign and queue the request:
    performRequest:parameters:success:failure:

 
 You can also work with requests sent to servers other than the Gree server.
 To sign any request with Gree credentials:
    signRequest:parameters:

 To submit the request to the Gree queue:
    HTTPRequestOperationWithRequest:success:failure:
    enqueueHTTPRequestOperation
